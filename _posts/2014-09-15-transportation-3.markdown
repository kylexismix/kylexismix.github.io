You'll need to get to Palm Springs.   


I knowIknowIknowIknow It's a long way  **HOWEVER** you will be amazed at the extreme levels of unadulterated awesome that exists in this gem of a small city.  Not to mention... us!  Here's some tips:

### Airports
**Palm Springs International (PSP)** This is a great option if you can get a direct flight. It is a smaller airport, but it puts you about a 5 minute Lyft from the downtown hotels.   
<br/>
**Ontario International (ONT)** Those traveling from outside of California may find better fares flying into Ontario. It's a straightforward one hour drive from Ontario to Palm Springs, and you get to see some pretty cool windmills on the way.
