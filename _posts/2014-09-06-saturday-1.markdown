### 5:00 PM - Marriage!
We will be getting married at 5, The sun should have just crept below the top of the mountain at that time, and Alex's long time friend, Nicole Guzman of Bird Rock Babe infamy, will perform her duty as clergy, and lead the service.

### 5:30 PM:
Kyle's new father in law Bruce Beach has generously promised to seal the deal with a dowery consisting of 37 goats, 6 chickens, two hamsters and one 9 year old, three legged Rhodesian ridgeback named Captain Pablo Gustav (he's a good boy).  These will be presented at this time, thus freaking out the entire rest of the hotel...  Not really..  Maybe...
