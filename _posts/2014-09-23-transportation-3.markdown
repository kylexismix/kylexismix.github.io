You'll need to get to Palm Springs.   


I knowIknowIknowIknow you're thinking "well those two are pretty ok, but sweet jayzus that's a long way from ev-er-y-thang!"  You are not wrong, it is, after all, the desert, and I will admit, I was once in your camp.  **HOWEVER** you will be amazed at the extreme levels of unadulterated awesome that exists in this gem of a small city.  Not to mention... us, and our pretty ok'edness.  Here's some tips:

#### Airports
**Palm Springs International (PSP)** This is a great option if you can get a direct flight. It is a smaller airport, but it puts you about a 5 minute Lyft from the downtown hotels.  
**Ontario International (ONT)** Those traveling from outside of California may find better fares flying into Ontario. It's a straightforward one hour drive from Ontario to Palm Springs, and you get to see some pretty cool windmills on the way.  

#### Around Palm Springs
**Lyft and Uber** Are readily available, we will provide a $15 Lyft credit per couple.
**Taxis** I guess those are still a thing.
**Bikes** Many of the hotels have a limited number for you to borrow.  If you feel like a Saturday morning activity, this would be fun.
**Walking** We planned everything around the downtown area. Depending on the temperature (hope for hot, not *really* hot) everything is an easily walkable.
