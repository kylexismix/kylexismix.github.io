                <em>Welcome to our wedding website!</em>:
                <br>
                I'm Kyle, she's Alexis.  We met one fine August day in 2015, when both of us
                swiped right on each other's dating profile.  I told Alexis I was going to give her a
                call, which Alexis thought was weird, but not weird enough to say no to pizza a block
                from her apartment in San Francisco.
                <br>
                <br>Our first date was memorable, Kyle skipped lunch, and as a result was a
              little bit "hangry".  It might have been this mental state or something in the air,
            but Alexis liked how he had no patience for the 1/3 pour of sauvingon blanc their waiter (he was very new)
            had brought her.  We decided we liked each other that evening, at least enough for a second date, where Alexis,
            fresh from a wild concert got her opportunity to show her humanity.</br>
            <br>Fast forward two years, countless fun memories, zero 1/3 pours, and one small shared studio later,
            Kyle put Alexis on the Gondola up aspen mountain,
          got down on one knee and asked her to marry him.  It took at least 4 "are you kidding!?'s" to establish
        that Kyle was in fact serious, and boom! Engaged! Bringing us to why you are here reading this today! </br>
